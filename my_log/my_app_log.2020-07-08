And baby, I hate to say it, most of them  actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.', 'Marilyn Monroe', 'friends, heartbreak, inspirational, life, love, sisters, ');]

All other recipes and measurements are enough to put the cake together and decorate it.MyCuStOmSpLiTerPreheat a fanforced oven to 140C (280F) or 160C (320F) for a conventional oven.

Mix on low speed until no dry ingredients are showing. Scrape down the bowl and mix for another 20 seconds.MyCuStOmSpLiTerSplit the batter into three different bowls and colour one teal, another pink and the third yellow using food gel colouring. Mix until well combined.MyCuStOmSpLiTerSpoon the different coloured batters into each cake pan alternating between each colour.MyCuStOmSpLiTerBake for 5060 min or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. If the pick comes out with wet batter, bake for a further 10 min at a time until fully baked. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature inside the cake tins and then chill them in the fridge overnight. Chilling your cakes overnight makes them easier to trim and decorate. So I bake my cakes the day before I decorate them.MyCuStOmSpLiTerTo trim your chilled cakes, use a cake leveller or large serrated knife to carefully trim the crust off the top of each cake before you trim each cake in half. Youll end up with 6 layers of cake.MyCuStOmSpLiTerTo crumb coat your cake, add a dab of frosting onto an 8 cake board or flat serving plate. Use a small offset spatula to spread the frosting around before adding the first cake layer. Gently press down the centre of the cake layer to make sure its stuck to the frosting underneath.MyCuStOmSpLiTerAdd frosting to a piping bag and frost a ring around the top of the cake. Fill the centre with more frosting. Use your small offset spatula to smoothen out the frosting before you add the next layer of cake. Repeat with the remaining layers.MyCuStOmSpLiTerAdd more frosting around and top and sides of the cake. Use the small spatula to smoothen out the top and sides of the cake, taking care to fill in any gaps in between each layer of cake.MyCuStOmSpLiTerUse a cake scraper (otherwise known as a bench scraper) to smoothen out the frosting on the sides and top. Get it as neat as you can. This should just be a neat, thin layer of frosting which is aimed at trapping any cake crumbs so that random bits of cake crumbs dont show up on the final layer of frosting. Chill for 2 hours or overnight.MyCuStOmSpLiTerYour cake is now crumb coated and ready to be covered in fondant! To prepare the fondant, youll need a large fondant roller. Dust a smooth work surface with powdered sugar. Place your ball of fondant on top and use the fondant roller to roll out your fondant to about the size of two large plates and about 1cm in thickness.MyCuStOmSpLiTerCarefully roll the fondant over your rolling pin and lift up and place on the cake. Use the palm of your hand to stick the fondant to the top of your cake before working the sides with the palm of your hand. Cut off any excess fondant with a small sharp knife before working on the very bottom of the cake. If you find your fondant looks lumpy once its on the cake, keep working it with the palm of your hand to smoothen it out.MyCuStOmSpLiTerFor the next part youll need three sea sponges. You can grab these from your local craft store in the paint section. Just make sure you give them a good wash before you use them and let them dry for a couple hours. Dip each sea sponge into your food dye and dab it onto the cake. Leave some parts white.MyCuStOmSpLiTerTo prepare the gold paint add gold lustre dust into a small mixing bowl along with rose spirit and mix until well combined. Use a small food safe brush to brush lines that look like little rivers on the fondant.

Mix on low speed until no dry ingredients are showing. Scrape down the bowl and mix for another 20 seconds.MyCuStOmSpLiTerSplit the batter into three different bowls and colour one teal, another pink and the third yellow using food gel colouring. Mix until well combined.MyCuStOmSpLiTerSpoon the different coloured batters into each cake pan alternating between each colour.MyCuStOmSpLiTerBake for 5060 min or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. If the pick comes out with wet batter, bake for a further 10 min at a time until fully baked. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature inside the cake tins and then chill them in the fridge overnight. Chilling your cakes overnight makes them easier to trim and decorate. So I bake my cakes the day before I decorate them.MyCuStOmSpLiTerTo trim your chilled cakes, use a cake leveller or large serrated knife to carefully trim the crust off the top of each cake before you trim each cake in half. Youll end up with 6 layers of cake.MyCuStOmSpLiTerTo crumb coat your cake, add a dab of frosting onto an 8 cake board or flat serving plate. Use a small offset spatula to spread the frosting around before adding the first cake layer. Gently press down the centre of the cake layer to make sure its stuck to the frosting underneath.MyCuStOmSpLiTerAdd frosting to a piping bag and frost a ring around the top of the cake. Fill the centre with more frosting. Use your small offset spatula to smoothen out the frosting before you add the next layer of cake. Repeat with the remaining layers.MyCuStOmSpLiTerAdd more frosting around and top and sides of the cake. Use the small spatula to smoothen out the top and sides of the cake, taking care to fill in any gaps in between each layer of cake.MyCuStOmSpLiTerUse a cake scraper (otherwise known as a bench scraper) to smoothen out the frosting on the sides and top. Get it as neat as you can. This should just be a neat, thin layer of frosting which is aimed at trapping any cake crumbs so that random bits of cake crumbs dont show up on the final layer of frosting. Chill for 2 hours or overnight.MyCuStOmSpLiTerYour cake is now crumb coated and ready to be covered in fondant! To prepare the fondant, youll need a large fondant roller. Dust a smooth work surface with powdered sugar. Place your ball of fondant on top and use the fondant roller to roll out your fondant to about the size of two large plates and about 1cm in thickness.MyCuStOmSpLiTerCarefully roll the fondant over your rolling pin and lift up and place on the cake. Use the palm of your hand to stick the fondant to the top of your cake before working the sides with the palm of your hand. Cut off any excess fondant with a small sharp knife before working on the very bottom of the cake. If you find your fondant looks lumpy once its on the cake, keep working it with the palm of your hand to smoothen it out.MyCuStOmSpLiTerFor the next part youll need three sea sponges. You can grab these from your local craft store in the paint section. Just make sure you give them a good wash before you use them and let them dry for a couple hours. Dip each sea sponge into your food dye and dab it onto the cake. Leave some parts white.MyCuStOmSpLiTerTo prepare the gold paint add gold lustre dust into a small mixing bowl along with rose spirit and mix until well combined. Use a small food safe brush to brush lines that look like little rivers on the fondant. This will give the cake a marble cake.', 'https:', None, '0');]

Cover with a clean tea towel and let them rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 30  40 minutes.MyCuStOmSpLiTerPreheat the oil in a large pot on medium high heat. Drop a small amount of dough into the oil and if it bubbles and fizzes around the sides the oil is hot enough. Gently and carefully drop donuts into the oil. Don't add more than three donuts at a time. Cook them on one side until they're a light golden brown then flip them over. Once they're golden on both sides carefully take them out and transfer them to a plate lined with kitchen paper towels to let the oil drain.MyCuStOmSpLiTerMeringue FrostingMyCuStOmSpLiTerPlace about an inch of water to a medium sized pot and bring it to the boil.MyCuStOmSpLiTerAdd your egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar to a large, clean metal bowl. Mix using a whisk or hand held mixer to help combine all the ingredients.MyCuStOmSpLiTerPlace the bowl with the egg mixture on top of your pot of boiling water making sure the bottom of the mixing bowl doesn't touch the bottom of the pot. Mix on high speed for 5 min or until the sugar in the mixture completely dissolves. You can check this by dipping two (clean) fingers into the mixture and if you can't feel any grains of sugar it's ready to take off the pot. Mix on high speed once you've taken it off the heat (about 56 min) until the mixture cools down and gets thick and glossy. You want to reach stiff peaks so that the frosting holds it's shape well.MyCuStOmSpLiTerTo finish donuts, poke three holes at the top and fill with lemon curd by adding lemon curd to a piping or zip lock bag.MyCuStOmSpLiTerFit the end of a piping bag with an open star tip and frost as demonstrated in the video. Finish off by toasting the meringue and garnish with mint leaves.MyCuStOmSpLiTerTo finish off the donuts simply poke a hole in the top of the donut and insert the bag with lemon curd filling in the donut. Fill with filling. Once all the donuts are filled carefully roll the donuts around in cinnamon sugar.MyCuStOmSpLiTerFit the end of a piping bag with an open star tip and frost in a swirl on top.

Let it rest 5  10 minutes in a warm spot until it becomes frothy.MyCuStOmSpLiTerAdd in milk, remaining granulated sugar (3 tablespoons  2 12 teaspoon), salt, 14 cup shortening, egg, egg yolk and vanilla.MyCuStOmSpLiTerAdd half of the flour and set mixer with whisk attachment and blend until smooth. Switch mixer to hook attachment, slowly add remaining flour and knead on low speed until smooth and elastic about 4  5 minutes, adding additional flour as needed (I only added about 2 tablespoons more. You shouldn't need a lot more, you want dough to be slightly sticky and tacky but shouldn't stick to a clean fingertip). Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until double in size, about 1 12 hours.MyCuStOmSpLiTerPunch dough down and roll into an even layer onto a floured surface to slightly less than 12inch thickness. Cut into doughnut shapes using a 3 inch cookie cutter. Cover with a clean tea towel and let them rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 30  40 minutes.MyCuStOmSpLiTerPreheat the oil in a large pot on medium high heat. Drop a small amount of dough into the oil and if it bubbles and fizzes around the sides the oil is hot enough. Gently and carefully drop donuts into the oil. Don't add more than three donuts at a time. Cook them on one side until they're a light golden brown then flip them over. Once they're golden on both sides carefully take them out and transfer them to a plate lined with kitchen paper towels to let the oil drain.MyCuStOmSpLiTerWhile the donuts are cooling prepare the cheesecake filling by adding the cream cheese and sugar or sweetened condensed milk to a large mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon to combine them or a hand mixer until the mixture is smooth. Transfer to a zip lock bag or piping bag.MyCuStOmSpLiTerTo finish off the donuts simply poke a hole in the top of the donut and insert the bag with cheesecake filling in the donut. Fill with filling. Once all the donuts are filled drizzle with choc sauce, sprinkle with crushed shortbread cookies and place two halves of a strawberry on top.MyCuStOmSpLiTerMyCuStOmSpLiTerDonuts are best served the day they're made.', 'https:', 'https:renditions3tastemadeweb2player.akamaized.netchocstrawberrycheesecakedonuts_l_enmp4chocstrawberrycheesecakedonuts_l_en5402000mp4.mp4', '0');]
